# BlockDemo

## Build tools & versions used
Xcode 14.2, iOS Simulator, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iOS 16.2

## Steps to run the app
To run this app, you can clone this repo and open with Xcode

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
For this project, a large portion of my focus was on the networking piece of the app.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I was trying to solve the problem of efficiently fetching remote data while adhering to modern networking practices. To solve this problem,
I utilized Swift concurrency and `async await`, which was recently introduced by Apple.

## How long did you spend on this project?
4 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
For the most part no. With more time, I would have built more meaningful and robust unit tests.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The unit tests

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
- For image caching, I used a Swift Package that builds off of SwiftUI's native `AsyncImage`. `AsyncImage` is a `View` that automatically loads
images from a remote URL. All the developer needs to do is supply the URL. It will allow you to provide a placeholder while the image is loading,
as well as handle errors fetching the image. I used a Swift Package called `CachedAsyncImage` that is the same thing, but it simply adds functionality 
to store fetched images in a `URLCache`, which is a native object that stores images on disk and in memory. The repo for this package can be found here: https://github.com/lorenzofiamingo/swiftui-cached-async-image

- For my unit tests, I copied `XCTAssertThrowsErrorAsync`, which builds off of the native `XCTAssertThrowsError` function but allows you to work 
with async functions that throw errors. I found this code here: https://arturgruchala.com/testing-async-await-exceptions/

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
Per the project instructions, I added logic to invalidate the entire list of employees and show the empty state if malformed data is returned 
from the API. However, I also included logic to handle this case and allow the developer to provide default values in this case, which I think would
be a better user experience.
